# Northwind Database and SQL Analysis

This project demonstrates my ability to build and query a relational database using **SQL**.

---

## 1. Database Structure (ERD)

I analysed the Northwind schema to understand the relationships between tables like Customers, Orders, and Products.

##  2. Basic SELECT Statements

This shows the initial database activation and basic retrieval of data from the Customers, Products, and Orders tables.

---

##  3. Distinct Values and Counting

I used `DISTINCT` and `COUNT(DISTINCT)` to find unique values within the Employee and Customer datasets.

##  4. Filtering with WHERE Clause

Examples of data filtering using specific criteria for Countries, Product IDs, and Prices.

---

##  5. Logical Operators (AND/OR)

Using `AND` and `OR` to combine filters for specific cities and Customer IDs.

##  6. Patterns and Subqueries

Demonstrating the use of `LIKE` patterns, `IN`, and basic **Subqueries** to filter locations.

##  7. Regional and Date Filtering

Advanced filtering for the UK/London market and specific date ranges using `LIKE` for name patterns.

---

##  8. Range and Membership Filters

Using `BETWEEN`, `IN`, and `NOT IN` to audit product prices and categories.

---

##  9. Sorting Data (ORDER BY)

Organizing query results in ascending (`ASC`) and descending (`DESC`) order using multiple columns.

---

##  10. Top Performers (LIMIT)

Using `ORDER BY` combined with `LIMIT` to extract the top-performing products and records.

---

## 11. Aggregations and Joins

Using `MAX`, `SUM`, and `AVG` for calculations, and an **INNER JOIN** to connect Products with Categories.

## Technical Skills Demonstrated
* **Database Management:** Schema analysis and table relationships.
* **Data Retrieval:** Advanced `SELECT` and `DISTINCT` queries.
* **Complex Filtering:** Logical operators, Wildcards, and Subqueries.
* **Data Analysis:** Aggregate functions (`SUM`, `AVG`) and Relational Joins.
